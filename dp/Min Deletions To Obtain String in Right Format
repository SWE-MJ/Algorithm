Description
We are given a string SS of length NN consisting only of letters A and/or B. Our goal is to obtain a string in the format A...AB...B. (all letters A occur before all letters B) by deleting some letters from SS. In particular, strings consisting only of letters A or only of letters B fit this format.

Write a function that, given a string SS, return the minimum number of letters that need to be deleted from SS in order to obtain a string in the above format.

Input: "BAAABAB"
Output: 2
Explanation: We can obtain "AAABB" by deleting the first occurrence of 'B' and the last occurrence of 'A'.

Input: "BBABAA"
Output: 3
Explanation: We can delete all occurrences of 'A' or 'B'.


const test = (S) => {
  let cntBs = 0, min = 0

  for(c of S) {
    if(c === 'A')
      min = Math.min(cntBs, min + 1)
    else
      cntBs++;
  }
  
  return min
}
